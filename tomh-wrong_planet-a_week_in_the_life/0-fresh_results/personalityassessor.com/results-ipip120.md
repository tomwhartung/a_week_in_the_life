This file contains my results from the 120-question quiz at [personalityassessor.com](personalityassessor.com).

- Taken 8/16/2025
- The page walks you through each question, very professionally I mIght add
- Did not get any errors, thankfully
- The results:
  - Are put into *percentiles* - see the `screenshots` directory
  - Appear to be reasonably consistent with both my prior results and my self-perception
    - A few of the facets seem a little skewed, eg., Openness -> Artistic Interests - low prob cuz I hate poetry
    - Thinking I might try the 300 question one later this week
- I created an account on the site!

**This questionnaire was much more friendly than the one at [personalityprobe.com](personalityprobe.com)!**


# Content of the Questionnaire

There are 120 questions, so I am guessing they are broken down as follows:

- 5 factors with 6 facets each = 30 total facets
- 4 questions for each of these 30 facets = 120 questions
- It uses the Likert Scale, so each question gets a score of 1-5
