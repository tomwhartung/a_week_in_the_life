- Taken 8/15/2025
- Each page has 10 questions that all cover the same facet
  - It lists the facet at the top of the page, which is not the best way to do things
  - It appeared that it presented the factors (and possibly the facets) in alphabetical order
- Site gave several errors, but reloading the page allowed me to continue working my way through
- The results appear to be reasonably consistent with both my prior results and my self-perception
