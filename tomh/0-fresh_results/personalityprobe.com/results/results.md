Results from the 300-question quiz at personalityprobe.com

- Taken 8/15/2025
- Each page has 10 questions that all cover the same facet
  - It lists the facet at the top of the page, which is not the best way to do things
  - It appeared that it presented the factors (and possibly the facets) in alphabetical order
- Site gave several errors, but reloading the page allowed me to continue working my way through
- The results appear to be reasonably consistent with both my prior results and my self-perception


# Summary of Results

**Total Openness - Percentile: 83.3%**
**Total Conscientious - Percentile: 75.42%**
**Total Extraversion - Percentile: 35%**
**Total Agreeableness - Percentile: 76.7%**
**Total Neurotic - Percentile: 35.4%**


# Understanding the Results

There are 300 questions, and the breakdown is as follows:

- 5 factors with 6 facets each = 30 total facets
- 10 questions for each of these 30 facets = 300 questions
- Each question gets a score of 1-5

## Calculating Percentiles

This can be a little complicated, so here's the breakdown:

### Median = Absolutely "Normal" **Raw** Score

- **Median raw** score on a **facet** is 3 * 10 = **30**
- **Median raw** score on a **factor** is 6 * 30 = **180**

### Lowest = Offset

Offset = Lowest Possible **Raw** Score

- **Lowest** possible **Raw Facet** score = 1 * 10 = Offset for a **Facet** = **10**
- **Lowest** possible **Raw Factor** score = 6 * 10 = Offset for a **Factor** = **60**

### Net_Score

Net_Score = Raw_Score - Offset

- Net_Score for a **Facet** = Raw_Score - Offset for a **Facet** = Raw_Score - 10
- Net_Score for a **Factor** = Raw_Score - Offset for a **Factor** = Raw_Score - 60

### Highest

Highest Possible = Most Extreme **Raw** Score

- **Highest** possible **raw** score on a **facet** is 5 * 10 = **50**
- **Highest** possible **raw** score on a **factor** is 6 * 50 = **300**

### Range

Range of **Facet** Scores = Maximum Possible - Lowest Possible

- Range of **Facet** Scores = 50 - 10 = **40**

### Percentile

So, the percentile is:

- Percentile for a **Facet:** ( Net Score / 40 ) * 100 = Net_Score * 2.5
  - Percentile for a **Facet** = Net_Score * 2.5
- Percentile for a **Factor:** ( Net Score / 240 ) * 100 = Net_Score * 0.4167
  - Percentile for a **Factor** = Net_Score * 0.4167

### Checks

Check the middle and both extremes for **Facets:**

- Lowest facet, Raw_Score = 10: [ ( 10 - 10 ) / 40 ] * 100 = [ 0 / 40 ] * 100 = 0%
  - Lowest facet, Net_Score = 0: Percentile = 0 * 2.5 = 0%
- Median facet, Raw_Score = 30: [ ( 30 - 10 ) / 40 ] * 100 = [ 20 / 40 ] * 100 = 50%
  - Median facet, Net_Score = 20: Percentile = 20 * 2.5 = 50%
- Highest facet, Raw_Score = 50: [ ( 50 - 10 ) / 40 ] * 100 = [40 / 40 ] * 100 = +100%
  - Highest facet, Net_Score = 40: Percentile = 40 * 2.5 = +100%

Check the middle and both extremes for **Factors:**

- Lowest factor, Raw_Score = 60: [ ( 60 - 60 ) / 40 ] * 100 = [ 0 / 40 ] * 100 = 0%
  - Lowest factor, Net_Score = 0: Percentile = 0 * 0.4167 = 0%
- Median factor, Raw_Score = 180: [ ( 180 - 60 ) / 40 ] * 100 = [ 20 / 40 ] * 100 = 50%
  - Median factor, Net_Score = 120: Percentile = 120 * 0.4167 = 50%
- Highest factor, Raw_Score = 300: [ ( 300 - 60 ) / 40 ] * 100 = [40 / 40 ] * 100 = +100%
  - Highest factor, Net_Score = 240: Percentile = 240 * 0.4167 = +100%
